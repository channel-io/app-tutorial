## Prerequisite

- [go](https://go.dev/) v1.21
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) v4; Check [here](wam) for wam.

## Installation

It is available to download the necessary packages for the project by running one of the following commands:

1. Use makefile.

```sh
$ make init
```

2. Use go cli.

```sh
$ go mod tidy
```

## Build

### Build the whole project

```sh
$ make build # it builds wam, either.
```

### Build only wam

```sh
$ make build-wam
```

## Run

### Configuration

Before running the program, make sure to check the [configuration](config/development.yml) file.

You must prepare the metadata of the app by registering one to Channel App Store.

```yaml
stage: development # name of the env

appId: # app id registered in advance
appSecret: # app secret issued in advance

api:
  public:
    http:
      port: 3022 # port number of the server

appStore:
  baseUrl: # api endpoint of the Channel App Store

bot:
  name: AppTutorialBot # bot name to write messages in groups
```

### Run the program

```sh
$ STAGE="your stage" make dev
```

The default setting for the stage is `development`.

## APIs

        }
    }
}
```

2. sendAsBot

`sendAsBot` is a function to write message as a bot.

You can set the name of the bot with [configuration](config) files.

    "params": {
        "input": {
            "groupId": "group id to write a message"
        }
    },
    "context": {
        "channel": {
